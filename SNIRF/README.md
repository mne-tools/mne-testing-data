# Shared Near Infrared Spectroscopy Format (SNIRF) 

This is the official file format of The Society for functional near-infrared spectroscopy (SfNIRS).

The specification can be found on their [github page](https://github.com/fNIRS/snirf).

The format is quite extensive and diferent manafacturers implement different aspects of the specification. I.e. The optional fields are not always used.

As such, there a range of files exported directly from vendors is stored here to ensure compatability across devices. We also include a file generated by the official SfNIRS converter.

This directory is structured by vendor, software/hardware, SNIRF version, files.
